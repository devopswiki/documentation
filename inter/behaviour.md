1. Tell me a time when you take initiatives to improve existing situation
I'm going to talk about a decision I made a few months ago. We migrate the CI/CD pipeline of our Debian modules from Jenkins to GitLab. 
There are more than 200 modules.  
Gitlab is used for code management, test automation and documentation. So, it is starting to be a critical service in our company. 
Before starting, I suggest my manager to set up tools for the monitoring of GitLab. I proposed the implementation of Graphana and Promotheuse. 
At the beginning, it was difficult to convince him because we didn't have time to implement these tools. 
But in the end he accepted, because I explained to him the advantages of these tools.
 
2. Tell me an occasion when you make a decision by taking into account opinions from others
One day, I no longer have disk space on the company's server to deploy a few services. I made a request to IT to expand the server memory. but they said it will take time to do it and it will be expensive.
So, I had a meeting with the managers and I explained to them the current problem and the possible solutions. I proposed using the clouds to deploy these services. My boss told me that there is a powerful PC that is not being used. So, I took this PC and I did the deployment.
 
3. Tell me a time when you made a mistake
For about 3 years, there was no CI/CD in our process. All test was done manually. I remember, I made a small correction in the software "change a path of the URL". We don't have enough time to qualify this RELEASE. We have to deliver this RELEASE as soon as possible. So I didn't do many tests. I tested only this modification, I said it is a minor correction, so nothing risky.
I sent the RELEASE to the client. But the next day, my boss comes to me with the director of the company. He told me that yesterday's version is obsolete and the client can't update with this version.
The situation is very complicated.  We spent a lot of time to reproduce the bug, to make the correction and finally to make another delivery.
So, I said that we have to change our way of working. I did some research and decided to implement the CI/CD environment. I proposed the idea to my boss who agreed in the end.  Since then we have no more problems like that.
 
4. What’s the technology that you’re best at?
I’m best at CI/CD that has become an essential part of the software development process.
5. What’s your last good surprise by a piece of technology?
I heard that VsCode is very usful, but i don’t have any reference about it. I’m surprise how it could be so usful.
